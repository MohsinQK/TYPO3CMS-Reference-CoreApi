.. php:class:: SystemEnvironmentBuilder

   Class to encapsulate base setup of bootstrap.
   
   This class contains all code that must be executed by every entry script.
   
   It sets up all basic paths, constants, global variables and checks
   the basic environment TYPO3 runs in.
   
   This class does not use any TYPO3 instance specific configuration, it only
   sets up things based on the server environment and core code. Even with a
   missing typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php this script will be successful.
   
   The script aborts execution with an error message if
   some part fails or conditions are not met.
   
   This script is internal code and subject to change.
   DO NOT use it in own code, or be prepared your code might
   break in future versions of the core.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/SystemEnvironmentBuilder.php>`__.
