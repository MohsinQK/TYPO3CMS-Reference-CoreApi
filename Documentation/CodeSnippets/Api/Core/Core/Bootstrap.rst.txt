.. php:class:: Bootstrap

   This class encapsulates bootstrap related methods.
   
   It is required directly as the very first thing in entry scripts and
   used to define all base things like constants and paths and so on.
   
   Most methods in this class have dependencies to each other. They can
   not be called in arbitrary order. The methods are ordered top down, so
   a method at the beginning has lower dependencies than a method further
   down. Do not fiddle with the load order in own scripts except you know
   exactly what you are doing!

   .. php:method:: init(\ClassLoader $classLoader, bool $failsafe)
   
      Bootstrap TYPO3 and return a Container that may be used
      to initialize an Application class.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Bootstrap.php#L70>`__.
      
      :param \ClassLoader $classLoader: an instance of the class loader
      :param bool $failsafe: true if no caching and a failsafe package manager should be used

   .. php:method:: createConfigurationManager()
   
      We need an early instance of the configuration manager.
      
      Since makeInstance relies on the object configuration, we create it here with new instead.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Bootstrap.php#L282>`__.
