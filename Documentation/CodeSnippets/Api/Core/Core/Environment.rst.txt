.. php:class:: Environment

   This class is initialized once in the SystemEnvironmentBuilder, and can then
   be used throughout the application to access common variables
   related to path-resolving and OS-/PHP-application specific information.
   
   It's main design goal is to remove any access to constants within TYPO3 code and to provide a static,
   for TYPO3 core and extensions non-changeable information.
   
   This class does not contain any HTTP related information, as this is handled in NormalizedParams functionality.
   
   All path-related methods do return the realpath to the paths without (!) the trailing slash.
   
   This class only defines what is configured through the environment, does not do any checks if paths exist
   etc. This should be part of the application or the SystemEnvironmentBuilder.
   
   In your application, use it like this: "Environment::isCli()"
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php>`__.

   
   .. php:method:: getContext()
   
      Delivers the ApplicationContext object, usually defined in TYPO3_CONTEXT environment variables.
      
      This is something like "Production", "Testing", or "Development" or any additional information
      "Production/Staging".
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php#L149>`__.

   .. php:method:: isComposerMode()
   
      Informs whether TYPO3 has been installed via composer or not. Typically this is useful inside the
      Maintenance Modules, or the Extension Manager.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php#L160>`__.
      
      :returntype: bool
      
   .. php:method:: isCli()
   
      Whether the current PHP request is handled by a CLI SAPI module or not.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php#L170>`__.
      
      :returntype: bool
      
   .. php:method:: getProjectPath()
   
      The root path to the project. For installations set up via composer, this is the path where your
      composer.json file is stored. For non-composer-setups, this is (due to legacy reasons) the public web folder
      where the TYPO3 installation has been unzipped (something like htdocs/ or public/ on your webfolder).
      
      However, non-composer-mode installations define an environment variable called "TYPO3_PATH_APP"
      to define a different folder (usually a parent folder) to allow TYPO3 to access and store data outside
      of the public web folder.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php#L185>`__.
      
      :returntype: string
      :returns: The absolute path to the project without the trailing slash
      
   .. php:method:: getPublicPath()
   
      The public web folder where index.php (= the frontend application) is put, without trailing slash.
      
      For non-composer installations, the project path = the public path.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php#L214>`__.
      
      :returntype: string
      
   .. php:method:: getVarPath()
   
      The folder where variable data like logs, sessions, locks, and cache files can be stored.
      
      When project path = public path, then this folder is usually typo3temp/var/, otherwise it's set to
      $project_path/var.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php#L226>`__.
      
      :returntype: string
      
   .. php:method:: getConfigPath()
   
      The folder where all global (= installation-wide) configuration like
      - LocalConfiguration.php,
      - AdditionalConfiguration.php, and
      - PackageStates.php
      is put.
      
      This folder usually has to be writable for TYPO3 in order to work.
      
      When project path = public path, then this folder is usually typo3conf/, otherwise it's set to
      $project_path/config.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Core/Environment.php#L244>`__.
