   .. php:method:: recursiveFileListSortingHelper()
   
      This is a helper method that can be used with u?sort methods to sort a list of (relative) file paths, e.g.
      
      array("someDir/fileA", "fileA", "fileB", "anotherDir/fileA").
      
      Directories are sorted first in the lists, with the deepest structures first (while every level is sorted
      alphabetically)
