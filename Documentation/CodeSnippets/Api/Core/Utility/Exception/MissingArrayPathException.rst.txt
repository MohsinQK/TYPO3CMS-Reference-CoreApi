.. php:class:: MissingArrayPathException

   Exception thrown if ArrayUtility::getValueByPath() and
   ArrayUtility::removeByPath() don't find the target path in given array.
   
   Note this extends from \RuntimeException to be backwards compatible with the
   formerly thrown \RuntimeException in the method.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Utility/Exception/MissingArrayPathException.php>`__.
