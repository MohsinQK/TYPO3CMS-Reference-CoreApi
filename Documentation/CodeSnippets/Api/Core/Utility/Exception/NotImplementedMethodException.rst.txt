   Exception thrown if a method is not implemented yet.
   
   Note this extends from \RuntimeException to be backwards compatible with the
   formerly thrown \RuntimeException in the methods.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Utility/Exception/NotImplementedMethodException.php>`__.
