.. php:class:: Registry

   A class to store and retrieve entries in a registry database table.
   
   This is a simple, persistent key-value-pair store.
   
   The intention is to have a place where we can store things (mainly settings)
   that should live for more than one request, longer than a session, and that
   shouldn't expire like it would with a cache. You can actually think of it
   being like the Windows Registry in some ways.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Registry.php>`__.

   
   .. php:method:: get(string $namespace, string $key, mixed $defaultValue)
   
      Returns a persistent entry.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Registry.php#L52>`__.
      
      :param string $namespace: Extension key of extension
      :param string $key: Key of the entry to return.
      :param mixed $defaultValue: Optional default value to use if this entry has never been set. Defaults to NULL.
      
   .. php:method:: set(string $namespace, string $key, mixed $value)
   
      Sets a persistent entry.
      
      This is the main method that can be used to store a key-value-pair.
      
      Do not store binary data into the registry, it's not build to do that,
      instead use the proper way to store binary data: The filesystem.

      :param string $namespace: Extension key of extension
      :param string $key: The key of the entry to set.
      :param mixed $value: The value to set. This can be any PHP data type; This class takes care of serialization
      
   .. php:method:: remove(string $namespace, string $key)
   
      Unset a persistent entry.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Registry.php#L112>`__.
      
      :param string $namespace: Extension key of extension
