   .. php:method:: getIconForResource(string $size, array $options)
   
      This method is used throughout the TYPO3 Backend to show icons for files and folders
      
      The method takes care of the translation of file extension to proper icon and for folders
      it will return the icon depending on the role of the folder.
      
      If the given resource is a folder there are some additional options that can be used:
       - mount-root => TRUE (to indicate this is the root of a mount)
       - folder-open => TRUE (to indicate that the folder is opened in the file tree)
      
      There is a hook in place to manipulate the icon name and overlays.
