   .. php:method:: convertPlainArrayToTypoScriptArray(array $plainArray)
   
      Returns an array with Typoscript the old way (with dot).
      
      Extbase converts the "classical" TypoScript (with trailing dot) to a format without trailing dot,
      to be more future-proof and not to have any conflicts with Fluid object accessor syntax.
      However, if you want to call legacy TypoScript objects, you somehow need the "old" syntax (because this is what TYPO3 is used to).
      With this method, you can convert the extbase TypoScript to classical TYPO3 TypoScript which is understood by the rest of TYPO3.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/TypoScript/TypoScriptService.php#L66>`__.
      
      :param array $plainArray: A TypoScript Array with Extbase Syntax (without dot but with _typoScriptNodeValue)
      :returntype: array
      :returns: Array with TypoScript as usual (with dot)
