.. php:class:: LanguageAspect

   The Aspect is usually available as "language" property, and
   can be used to find out the "overlay"/data retrieval strategy.
   
   "id" (languageId, int)
   - formally known as $TSFE->sys_language_uid
   - the requested language of the current page (frontend)
   - used in menus and links to generate "links in language with this ID"
   
   "contentId" (int)
   - formally known as $TSFE->sys_language_content
   - the language of records to be fetched
   - if empty, "languageId" is used.
   
   "fallbackChain"
    - when "fallback" go with
    - depends what "contentId" value should be set
    - defined in config.sys_language_mode (strict/content_fallback:4,5,stop/ignore?)
    - previously known as $TSFE->sys_language_mode
    - defines "contentId" based on "if the current page is available in this language"
     - "strict"
     - "fallback" if current page is not available, check the fallbackChain"
     - "fallbackAndIgnore"
   
   "overlayType"
   - defines which way the records should be fetched from ($TSFE->sys_language_contentOL and config.sys_language_overlay)
   - usually you fetch language 0 and -1, then take the "contentId" and "overlay" them
      - here you have two choices
            1. "on" if there is no overlay, do not render the default language records ("hideNonTranslated")
            2. "mixed" - if there is no overlay, just keep the default language, possibility to have mixed languages - config.sys_language_overlay = 1
            3. "off" - do not do overlay, only fetch records available in the current "contentId" (see above), and do not care about overlays or fallbacks - fallbacks could be an option here, actually that is placed on top
            4. "includeFloating" - on + includeRecordsWithoutDefaultTranslation

   .. php:method:: getId()
   
      Returns the language ID the current page was requested,
      this is relevant when building menus or links to other pages.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Context/LanguageAspect.php#L114>`__.
      
      :returntype: int
      
   .. php:method:: getContentId()
   
      Contains the language UID of the content records that should be overlaid to would be fetched.
      
      This is especially useful when a page requested with language=4 should fall back to showing
      content of language=2 (see fallbackChain)
