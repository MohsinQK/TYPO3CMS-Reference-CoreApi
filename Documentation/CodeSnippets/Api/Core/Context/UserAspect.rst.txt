   - username

   .. php:method:: get()
   
      Fetch common information about the user

   .. php:method:: isLoggedIn()
   
      A user is logged in if the user has a UID, but does not care about groups.
      
      For frontend purposes, it is possible to e.g. simulate groups, but this would still be defined as "not logged in".
      
      For backend, only the check on the user ID is used.
