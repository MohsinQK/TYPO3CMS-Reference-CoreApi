.. php:namespace::  TYPO3\CMS\Core\Context

.. php:class:: Context

   Contains the state of a current page request, to be used when reading
   information of the current request in which configuration/context
   it is used.
   
   Typically, the current main context is initialized very early within each entry-point application,
   and is then modified overridden in e.g. PSR-15 middlewares (e.g. authentication, preview settings etc).
   
   For most use-cases, the current main context is fetched via GeneralUtility::makeInstance(Context::class),
   however, if custom settings for a single use-case is necessary, it is recommended to clone the base context:
   
   $mainContext = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(Context::class);
   $customContext = clone $mainContext;
   $customContext->setAspect(GeneralUtility::makeInstance(VisibilityAspect::class, true, true, false))
   
   ... which in turn can be injected in the various places where TYPO3 uses contexts.
   
   
   Classic aspect names to be used are:
   - date (DateTimeAspect)
   - workspace
   - visibility
   - frontend.user
   - backend.user
   - language
   - frontend.preview [if EXT:frontend is loaded]
   - typoscript
