   .. php:method:: set()
   
      Performs the same operation as {@see or()} without the need to create a BitSet instance from
      an integer value.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Type/Bitmask/BackendGroupMountOption.php#L81>`__.

   .. php:method:: unset()
   
      Performs the same operation as {@see andNot()} without the need to create a BitSet instance from
      an integer value.

      :returntype: bool
      
   .. php:method:: clear()
   
      Sets all of the bits in this BitSet to false.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Type/Bitmask/BackendGroupMountOption.php#L122>`__.
      
      
   .. php:method:: and()
   
      Performs a logical AND of this target bit set with the argument bit set. This bit set is
      modified so that each bit in it has the value true if and only if it both initially had the
      value true and the corresponding bit in the bit set argument also had the value true.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Type/Bitmask/BackendGroupMountOption.php#L134>`__.
      
      
   .. php:method:: or()
   
      Performs a logical OR of this bit set with the bit set argument. This bit set is modified so
      that a bit in it has the value true if and only if it either already had the value true or
      the corresponding bit in the bit set argument has the value true.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Type/Bitmask/BackendGroupMountOption.php#L146>`__.
      
      
   .. php:method:: xor()
   
      Performs a logical XOR of this bit set with the bit set argument. This bit set is modified so
      that a bit in it has the value true if and only if one of the following statements holds:
      
      - The bit initially has the value true, and the corresponding bit
        in the argument has the value false.
      - The bit initially has the value false, and the corresponding bit
        in the argument has the value true.

   .. php:method:: andNot()
   
      Clears all of the bits in this BitSet whose corresponding bit is set in the specified BitSet.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Type/Bitmask/BackendGroupMountOption.php#L172>`__.
      
      
   .. php:method:: __toInt()
   
      Returns the integer representation of the internal set.
      
      (As PHP does not know a byte type, the internal set is already handled as an integer and can
      therefore directly be returned)
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Type/Bitmask/BackendGroupMountOption.php#L184>`__.
      
      :returntype: int
      
   .. php:method:: __toString()
   
      Returns the (binary) string representation of the internal (integer) set.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Type/Bitmask/BackendGroupMountOption.php#L194>`__.
