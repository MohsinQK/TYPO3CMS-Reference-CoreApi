   RFC 822 Email address list validation Utility
   
   What is it?
   
   This class will take an address string, and parse it into it's constituent
   parts, be that either addresses, groups, or combinations. Nested groups
   are not supported. The structure it returns is pretty straight forward,
   and is similar to that provided by the imap_rfc822_parse_adrlist(). Use
   print_r() to view the structure.
   
   How do I use it?
   
   $address_string = 'My Group: "Richard" <richard@localhost> (A comment), ted@example.com (Ted Bloggs), Barney;';
   $structure = Mail_RFC822::parseAddressList($address_string, 'example.com', TRUE)
   print_r($structure);

   .. php:method:: parseAddressList(string $address, string $default_domain, bool $validate)
   
      Starts the whole process. The address must either be set here
      or when creating the object. One or the other.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Mail/Rfc822AddressesParser.php#L162>`__.
      
      :param string $address: The address(es) to validate.
      :param string $default_domain: Default domain/host etc.
      :param bool $validate: Whether to validate atoms. Turn this off if you need to run addresses through before encoding the personal names, for instance.
