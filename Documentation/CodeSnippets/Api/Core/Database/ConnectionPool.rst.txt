.. php:class:: ConnectionPool

   Manager that handles opening/retrieving database connections.
   
   It's a facade to the actual Doctrine DBAL DriverManager that implements TYPO3
   specific functionality like mapping individual tables to different database
   connections.
   
   getConnectionForTable() is the only supported way to get a connection that
   honors the table mapping configuration.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Database/ConnectionPool.php>`__.

   .. php:const:: DEFAULT_CONNECTION_NAME
   
      :php:`'Default'`, type string
      
      
   
   .. php:method:: getConnectionForTable()
   
      Creates a connection object based on the specified table name.
      
      This is the official entry point to get a database connection to ensure
      that the mapping of table names to database connections is honored.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Database/ConnectionPool.php#L86>`__.

   .. php:method:: getConnectionByName()
   
      Creates a connection object based on the specified identifier.
      
      This method should only be used in edge cases. Use getConnectionForTable() so
      that the tablename<>databaseConnection mapping will be taken into account.

   .. php:method:: getQueryBuilderForTable()
   
      Returns the connection specific query builder object that can be used to build
      complex SQL queries using and object oriented approach.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Database/ConnectionPool.php#L228>`__.

   .. php:method:: resetConnections()
   
      Reset internal list of connections.
      
      Currently primarily used in functional tests to close connections and start
      new ones in between single tests.
