.. php:class:: SlugEnricher

   New records that are capable of handling slugs (TCA type 'slug'), always
   require the field value to be set in order to run through the validation
   process to create a new slug. Fields having `null` as value are ignored
   and can be used to by-pass implicit slug initialization.
