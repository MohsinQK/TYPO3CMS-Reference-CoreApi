.. php:class:: Features

   A lightweight API class to check if a feature is enabled.
   
   Features are simple options (true/false), and are stored in the
   global configuration array $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][features].
   
   For disabling or enabling a feature the "ConfigurationManager"
   should be used.
   
   -- Naming --
   
   Feature names should NEVER named "enable" or having a negation, or containing versions or years
      "enableFeatureXyz"
      "disableOverlays"
      "schedulerRevamped"
      "useDoctrineQueries"
      "disablePreparedStatements"
      "disableHooksInFE"
   
   Proper namings for features
      "ExtendedRichtextFormat"
      "NativeYamlParser"
      "InlinePageTranslations"
      "TypoScriptParserIncludesAsXml"
      "NativeDoctrineQueries"
   
   Ideally, these feature switches are added via the Install Tool or via FactoryConfiguration
   and can be used for Extensions as well.
   
   --- Usage ---
   
   if (GeneralUtility::makeInstance(Features::class)->isFeatureEnabled('InlineSvg')) {
     ... do stuff here ...
   }
