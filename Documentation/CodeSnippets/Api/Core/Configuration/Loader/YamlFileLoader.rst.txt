.. php:class:: YamlFileLoader

   A YAML file loader that allows to load YAML files, based on the Symfony/Yaml component
   
   In addition to just load a YAML file, it adds some special functionality.
   
   - A special "imports" key in the YAML file allows to include other YAML files recursively.
     The actual YAML file gets loaded after the import statements, which are interpreted first,
     at the very beginning. Imports can be referenced with a relative path.
   
   - Merging configuration options of import files when having simple "lists" will add items to the list instead
     of overwriting them.
   
   - Special placeholder values set via %optionA.suboptionB% replace the value with the named path of the configuration
     The placeholders will act as a full replacement of this value.
   
   - Environment placeholder values set via %env(option)% will be replaced by env variables of the same name
