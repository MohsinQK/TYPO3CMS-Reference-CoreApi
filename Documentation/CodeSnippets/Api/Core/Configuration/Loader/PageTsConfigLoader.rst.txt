.. php:class:: PageTsConfigLoader

   Traverses a root line of a pagetree up and includes all available TSconfig settings, including default
   setup. Then include lines are checked, and merged together into one string, ready to be parsed.
   
   Can be used in Frontend or Backend.
   
   Have a look at the PageTsConfigParser which can then parse (and cache) this information based on the environment (Frontend / Backend / current page).
   
   Currently, this accumulated information of the pages is NOT cached, as it would need to be tagged with any
   page, also including external files.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Configuration/Loader/PageTsConfigLoader.php>`__.

   
   .. php:method:: load()
