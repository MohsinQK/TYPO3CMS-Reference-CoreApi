   .. php:method:: retrieveFileOrFolderObject()
   
      Bulk function, can be used for anything to get a file or folder
      
      1. It's a UID
      2. It's a combined identifier
      3. It's just a path/filename (coming from the oldstyle/backwards compatibility)
      
      Files, previously laid on fileadmin/ or something, will be "mapped" to the storage the file is
      in now. Files like typo3temp/ or typo3conf/ will be moved to the first writable storage
      in its processing folder
      
      $input could be
      - "2:myfolder/myfile.jpg" (combined identifier)
      - "23" (file UID)
      - "uploads/myfile.png" (backwards-compatibility, storage "0")
      - "file:23"
