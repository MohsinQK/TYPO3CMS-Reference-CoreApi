.. php:class:: abstract AbstractTask

   Abstract base implementation of a task.
   
   If you extend this class, make sure that you redefine the member variables $type and $name
   or set them in the constructor. Otherwise your task won't be recognized by the system and several
   things will fail.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Resource/Processing/AbstractTask.php>`__.
