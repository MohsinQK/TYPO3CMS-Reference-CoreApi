.. php:class:: AfterFileMarkedAsMissingEvent

   This event is fired once a file was just marked as missing in the database (sys_file).
   
   Example: If a file is marked as missing, listeners can try to recover a file. This can happen on specific setups
   where editors also work via FTP.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Resource/Event/AfterFileMarkedAsMissingEvent.php>`__.
