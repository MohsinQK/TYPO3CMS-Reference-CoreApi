   .. php:method:: initialize(array $configuration)
   
      Explicitly initializes all necessary Extbase objects by invoking the various initialize* methods.
      
      Usually this method is only called from unit tests or other applications which need a more fine grained control over
      the initialization and request handling process. Most other applications just call the run() method.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/extbase/Classes/Core/Bootstrap.php#L88>`__.
      
      :param array $configuration: The TS configuration array
      
   .. php:method:: run(string $content, array $configuration, \ServerRequestInterface $request)
   
      Runs the the Extbase Framework by resolving an appropriate Request Handler and passing control to it.
      
      If the Framework is not initialized yet, it will be initialized.
      
      This is usually used in Frontend plugins.
