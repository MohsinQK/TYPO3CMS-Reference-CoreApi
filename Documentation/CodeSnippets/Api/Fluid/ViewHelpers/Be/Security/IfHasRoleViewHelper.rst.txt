.. php:class:: IfHasRoleViewHelper

   This ViewHelper implements an ifHasRole/else condition for backend users
   and backend groups.
   
   Role refers to backend user groups. The :html:`role` attribute can either be
   the title of a group, or the uid.
   
   Examples
   ========
   
   Basic usage::
   
      <f:be.security.ifHasRole role="Administrator">
         This is being shown in case the current BE user belongs to a BE usergroup (aka role) titled "Administrator" (case sensitive)
      </f:be.security.ifHasRole>
   
   Everything inside the :html:`<f:ifHasRole>` tag is being displayed if the
   logged in backend user belongs to the specified backend group.
   
   Using the usergroup uid as role identifier::
   
      <f:be.security.ifHasRole role="1">
         This is being shown in case the current BE user belongs to a BE usergroup (aka role) with the uid "1"
      </f:be.security.ifHasRole>
   
   Everything inside the :html:`<f:ifHasRole>` tag is being displayed if the
   logged in backend user belongs to the specified backend group.
   
   IfRole / then / else::
   
      <f:be.security.ifHasRole role="Administrator">
         <f:then>
            This is being shown in case you have the role.
         </f:then>
         <f:else>
            This is being displayed in case you do not have the role.
         </f:else>
      </f:be.security.ifHasRole>
   
   Everything inside the :html:`<f:then></f:then>` tag is displayed if the
   logged in backend user belongs to the specified backend group.
   Otherwise, everything inside the :html:`<f:else></f:else>` tag is displayed.

   .. php:method:: initializeArguments()
   
      Initializes the "role" argument.
      
      Renders <f:then> child if the current logged in BE user belongs to the specified role (aka usergroup)
      otherwise renders <f:else> child.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/fluid/Classes/ViewHelpers/Be/Security/IfHasRoleViewHelper.php#L71>`__.
      
      
   .. php:method:: render()
   
      Renders <f:then> child if $condition is true, otherwise renders <f:else> child.
      
      Method which only gets called if the template is not compiled. For static calling,
      the then/else nodes are converted to closures and condition evaluation closures.

   .. php:method:: verdict()
   
      Static method which can be overridden by subclasses. If a subclass
      requires a different (or faster) decision then this method is the one
      to override and implement.
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/fluid/Classes/ViewHelpers/Be/Security/IfHasRoleViewHelper.php#L97>`__.
      
      
   .. php:method:: compile()
   
      The compiled ViewHelper adds two new ViewHelper arguments: __thenClosure and __elseClosure.
      
      These contain closures which are be executed to render the then(), respectively else() case.
