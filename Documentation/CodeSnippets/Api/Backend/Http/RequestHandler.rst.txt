.. php:class:: RequestHandler

   General RequestHandler for the TYPO3 Backend. This is used for all Backend requests, including AJAX routes.
   
   If a get/post parameter "route" is set, the Backend Routing is called and searches for a
   matching route inside the Router. The corresponding controller / action is called then which returns the response.
   
   The following get/post parameters are evaluated here:
     - route
     - token
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Http/RequestHandler.php>`__.
