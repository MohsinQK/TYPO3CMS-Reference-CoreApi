.. php:class:: NodeFactory

   Create an element object depending on renderType.
   
   This is the main factory to instantiate any node within the render
   chain of FormEngine. All nodes must implement NodeInterface.
   
   Nodes are "container" classes of the render chain, "element" classes that
   render single elements, as well as "fieldWizard", "fieldInformation" and
   "fieldControl" classes which are called by single elements to enrich them.
   
   This factory gets a string "renderType" and then looks up in a list which
   specific class should handle this renderType. This list can be extended with
   own renderTypes by extensions, existing renderTypes can be overridden, and
   - for complex cases - it is possible to register own resolver classes for single
   renderTypes that can return a node class name to override the default lookup list.
