.. php:class:: SuggestWizardDefaultReceiver

   Default implementation of a handler class for an ajax record selector.
   
   Normally other implementations should be inherited from this one.
   queryTable() should not be overwritten under normal circumstances.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Form/Wizard/SuggestWizardDefaultReceiver.php>`__.

   
   .. php:method:: queryTable(int $recursionCounter)
   
      Queries a table for records and completely processes them
      
      Returns a two-dimensional array of almost finished records; the only need to be put into a <li>-structure
      
      If you subclass this class, you will most likely only want to overwrite the functions called from here, but not
      this function itself
