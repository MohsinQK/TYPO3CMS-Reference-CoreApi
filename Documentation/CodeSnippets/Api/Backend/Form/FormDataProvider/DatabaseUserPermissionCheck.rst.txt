   .. php:method:: addData()
   
      Set userPermissionOnPage to result array and check access rights.
      
      A couple of different exceptions are thrown here:
      * If something weird happens a top level SPL exception is thrown.
        This indicates a non recoverable error.
      * If user has no access to whatever should be done, an exception that
        extends from Form\Exception\AccessDeniedException is thrown. This
        can be caught by upper level controller code and can be translated
        to a specific error message that is shown to the user depending on
        specific exception that is thrown.
