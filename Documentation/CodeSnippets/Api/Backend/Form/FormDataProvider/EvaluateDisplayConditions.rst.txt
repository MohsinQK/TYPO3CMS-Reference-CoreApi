.. php:class:: EvaluateDisplayConditions

   Class EvaluateDisplayConditions implements the TCA 'displayCond' option.
   
   The display condition is a colon separated string which describes
   the condition to decide whether a form field should be displayed.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Form/FormDataProvider/EvaluateDisplayConditions.php>`__.

   .. php:method:: addData()
   
      Remove fields from processedTca columns that should not be displayed.
      
      Strategy of the parser is to first find all displayCond in given tca
      and within all type=flex fields to parse them into an array. This condition
      array contains all information to evaluate that condition in a second
      step that - depending on evaluation result - then throws away or keeps the field.
