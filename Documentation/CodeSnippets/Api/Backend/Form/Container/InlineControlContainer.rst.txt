.. php:class:: InlineControlContainer

   Inline element entry container.
   
   This container is the entry step to rendering an inline element. It is created by SingleFieldContainer.
   
   The code creates the main structure for the single inline elements, initializes
   the inlineData array, that is manipulated and also returned back in its manipulated state.
   The "control" stuff of inline elements is rendered here, for example the "create new" button.
   
   For each existing inline relation an InlineRecordContainer is called for further processing.
