.. php:class:: InlineRecordContainer

   Render a single inline record relation.
   
   This container is called by InlineControlContainer to render single existing records.
   Furthermore it is called by FormEngine for an incoming ajax request to expand an existing record
   or to create a new one.
   
   This container creates the outer HTML of single inline records - eg. drag and drop and delete buttons.
   For rendering of the record itself processing is handed over to FullRecordContainer.
