.. php:class:: FlexFormSectionContainer

   Handle flex form sections.
   
   This container is created by FlexFormElementContainer if a "single" element is in
   fact a section. For each existing section container it creates as FlexFormContainerContainer
   to render its inner fields.
   Additionally, a button for each possible container is rendered with information for the
   ajax controller that fetches one on click.
