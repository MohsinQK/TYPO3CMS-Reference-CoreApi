.. php:class:: FieldControl

   Field controls are additional HTML on a single element level that are typically
   shown right aside the main element HTML.
   
   They are restricted to only allow an icon as output.
   
   The "edit popup" button next to a select field of a renderType "selectMultipleSideBySide"
   is an example of such an additional control.
   
   The element itself must position any field controls at an appropriate place.
   For instance the "group" element shows them in a row vertically, while others
   display single controls next to each other.
