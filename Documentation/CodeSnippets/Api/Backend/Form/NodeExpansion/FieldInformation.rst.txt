.. php:class:: FieldInformation

   Field information are additional HTML on a single node level that are typically
   shown between the label and the main element. They are registered in ['config']['fieldInformation']
   TCA section and each element may merge that with default registered information.
   
   Field information must not add additional functionality to the element. They are only
   allowed to add "informational" stuff like links, div and spans and similar.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Form/NodeExpansion/FieldInformation.php>`__.
