.. php:class:: FieldWizard

   Field wizards are additional HTML on a single element level that are typically
   shown below the element input. They are registered in ['config']['fieldWizard']
   TCA section and each element may merge that with default wizards.
   
   Field wizards may add additional functionality to the element. They could add
   new ajax controllers for instance or add buttons and are not restricted by the
   framework further.
   
   Examples for field wizards are the display of the "language diff" in input elements
   and the file upload button in group elements.
