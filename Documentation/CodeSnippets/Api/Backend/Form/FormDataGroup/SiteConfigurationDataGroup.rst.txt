.. php:class:: SiteConfigurationDataGroup

   A data provider group for site and language configuration.
   
   This data group is for data fetched from sites yml files,
   it is fed by "fake TCA" since there are no real db records.
   
   It's similar to "fullDatabaseRecord", with some unused TCA types
   kicked out and some own data providers for record data and inline handling.
