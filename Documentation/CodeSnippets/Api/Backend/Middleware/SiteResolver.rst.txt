.. php:class:: SiteResolver

   Usually called after the route object is resolved, however, this is not possible yet as this happens
   within the RequestHandler/RouteDispatcher right now and should go away.
   
   This middleware checks for a "id" parameter. If present, it adds a site information to this page ID.
   
   Very useful for all "Web" related modules to resolve all available languages for a site.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Middleware/SiteResolver.php>`__.

   
   .. php:method:: process()
   
      Resolve the site information by checking the page ID ("id" parameter) which is typically used in BE modules
      of type "web".
      
      See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Middleware/SiteResolver.php#L55>`__.
