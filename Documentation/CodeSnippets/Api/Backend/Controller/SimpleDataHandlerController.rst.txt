.. php:namespace::  TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Controller

.. php:class:: SimpleDataHandlerController

   Script Class, creating object of \TYPO3\CMS\Core\DataHandling\DataHandler and
   sending the posted data to the object.
   
   Used by many smaller forms/links in TYPO3, including the QuickEdit module.
   Is not used by FormEngine though (main form rendering script) - that uses the same class (DataHandler) but makes its own initialization (to save the redirect request).
   For all other cases than FormEngine it is recommended to use this script for submitting your editing forms - but the best solution in any case would probably be to link your application to FormEngine, that will give you easy form-rendering as well.
