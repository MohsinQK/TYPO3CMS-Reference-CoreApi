.. php:class:: Router

   Implementation of a class for adding routes, collecting throughout the Bootstrap
   to register all sorts of Backend Routes, and to fetch the main Collection in order
   to resolve a route (see ->match() and ->matchRequest()).
   
   Ideally, the Router is solely instantiated and accessed via the Bootstrap, the RequestHandler and the UriBuilder.
   
   See \TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Http\RequestHandler for more details on route matching() and Bootstrap->initializeBackendRouting().
   
   The architecture is inspired by the Symfony Routing Component.
