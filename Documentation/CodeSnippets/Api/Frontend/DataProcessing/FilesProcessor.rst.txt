.. php:class:: FilesProcessor

   This data processor can be used for processing data for record which contain
   relations to sys_file records (e.g. sys_file_reference records) or for fetching
   files directly from UIDs or from folders or collections.
   
   Example TypoScript configuration:
   
   10 = TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\DataProcessing\FilesProcessor
   10 {
     references.fieldName = image
     collections = 13,15
     as = myfiles
   }
   
   whereas "myfiles" can further be used as a variable {myfiles} inside a Fluid template for iteration.
