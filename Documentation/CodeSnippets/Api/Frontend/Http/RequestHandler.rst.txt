.. php:class:: RequestHandler

   This is the main entry point of the TypoScript driven standard front-end.
   
   "handle()" is called when all PSR-15 middlewares have been set up the PSR-7 ServerRequest object and the following
   things have been evaluated
   - correct page ID, page type (typeNum), rootline, MP etc.
   - info if is cached content already available
   - proper language
   - proper TypoScript which should be processed.
   
   Then, this class is able to render the actual HTTP body part built via TypoScript. Here this is split into two parts:
   - Everything included in <body>, done via page.10, page.20 etc.
   - Everything around.
   
   If the content has been built together within the cache (cache_pages), it is fetched directly, and
   any so-called "uncached" content is generated again.
   
   Some further hooks allow to post-processing the content.
   
   Then the right HTTP response headers are compiled together and sent as well.
