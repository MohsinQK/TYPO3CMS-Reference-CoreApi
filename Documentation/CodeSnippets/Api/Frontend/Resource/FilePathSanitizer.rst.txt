.. php:class:: FilePathSanitizer

   Checks if a given file path is allowed to be used in TYPO3 Frontend.
   
   Currently allowed is:
   - a file (which must exist) from any of the allowedPaths option, without any ".." inside the path name
   - an external URL
   
   The sanitize method either returns a full URL (in case it's a valid http/https resource)
   or a path relative to the public folder of the TYPO3 Frontend.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Resource/FilePathSanitizer.php>`__.
