.. php:class:: PageResolver

   Resolve the page ID based on TYPO3's routing functionality configured in a site.
   
   Processes the page ID, page type (typeNum) and other parameters built from queryArguments and routeParameters.
   After this point we have an array, TSFE->page, which is the page-record of the current page, $TSFE->id.
   
   However, if there is a backend user logged in and he has NO access to this page (and the page is hidden),
   then the ID is determined again and the backend user is not considered for the rest of the frontend request.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Middleware/PageResolver.php>`__.
