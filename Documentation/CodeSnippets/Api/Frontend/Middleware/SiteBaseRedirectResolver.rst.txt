.. php:class:: SiteBaseRedirectResolver

   Resolves redirects of site if base is not /
   Can be replaced or extended by extensions if GeoIP-based or user-agent based language redirects need to happen.
   
   Please note that the redirect usually does not contain the Query Parameters, as special query parameters
   like "id", "L" and "cHash" could then result in an error loop.
   One special case (adding a "/") is keeping the query parameters though.
