.. php:class:: SiteResolver

   Identifies if a site is configured for the request, based on "id" and "L" GET/POST parameters, or the requested
   string.
   
   If a site is found, the request is populated with the found language+site objects. If none is found, the main magic
   is handled by the PageResolver middleware.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Middleware/SiteResolver.php>`__.
