.. php:class:: BackendUserAuthenticator

   This middleware authenticates a Backend User (be_user) (pre)-viewing a frontend page.
   
   This middleware also ensures that $GLOBALS['LANG'] is available, however it is possible that
   a different middleware later-on might unset the BE_USER as he/she is not allowed to preview a certain
   page due to rights management. As this can only happen once the page ID is resolved, this will happen
   after the routing middleware.
   
   See source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Middleware/BackendUserAuthenticator.php>`__.
